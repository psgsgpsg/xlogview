From SVN version 7, logview uses *boost::regex* to enhance text filter.

Requirement for boost includes:
 # Multi thread
 # Static Link
 # Regex component.

*Boost* used in this project can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/xlogview/downloads/detail?name=boost_1.51.0_library.7z

So before you build *LogView*, you need to modify *"Additional Include Directory"* and *"Additional Library Directory"* to indicate the right position of *boost* library.
